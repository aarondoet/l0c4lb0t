This project is cancelled.

## Why?

There are several reasons behind this that I want to explain below

### 1. It was my first project ever using Reactor/reactive programming

The code does not meet my standards anymore. It was a fun project to learn reactive programming with but as a beginner you just write bad code. That is just how it is.
I got better and better with this programming paradigm and when looking at the code I just don't like it anymore. There's a lot of stuff I did too complicated because I did not know how Reactor works.
While I tried to sometimes update the code that had those issues I don't think that really is a good idea to maintain the bot.

### 2. I have no motivation

Right now I don't have the motivation to work on this anymore. The problem stated above also one reason for this.
When I have motivation again I will continue but right now I just can't do that.

### 3. I have no time

I don't want to use this as an excuse and I have enough time but at the moment I have other stuff to do and I want to have some free time too.
So I **do** have time but I'd rather use it for something else. I joined a dev team a while ago and might join another team in the near future which means that I already have less time.

## What now?

I won't work on this bot anymore. As I said above I want to continue but mostly because of the first problem I mentioned I will start over again.
This version of the bot is dead. My plan is to start again from scratch and with a better plan than before. I will reuse some of this bot's code because it is okay and I don't want to change it (this especially applies to some functions in the BotUtils class) but a lot of stuff will be completely new, for example the command handling part.
The command handling will mostly work the same way but I will rewrite stuff like that.

This repo is now archived. When I start working on the new version of the bot I will rename this repo so that the new repo can get this name again, I'd rather create a new repo for the new version than just overwriting this one.
